4/19/23, 12:52 - Sumit Mali: What is meant by virtualization? In cloud Computing, in 5 lines

Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of a physical resource, such as a server, operating system, or network. In cloud computing, virtualization is used to create multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server or across a cluster of servers. This allows for more efficient use of resources and better utilization of hardware. Virtualization enables rapid scaling of resources, as VMs can be quickly provisioned or de-provisioned as needed. It also allows for better isolation of workloads and increased security.
4/19/23, 12:52 - Sumit Mali: What does virtual machine do?In cloud Computing, in 5 lines

A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer, including the operating system, hardware, and software. In cloud computing, virtual machines are used to provide a scalable and flexible infrastructure. They allow multiple instances of an operating system to run on a single physical machine, which can be easily provisioned or de-provisioned as needed. VMs are isolated from each other, providing better security and stability. They can be used to host applications, databases, web servers, and other services in the cloud.
4/19/23, 12:52 - Sumit Mali: What is the role of VM Ware in virtual machine?In cloud Computing, in 5 lines

VMware is a software company that specializes in virtualization and cloud computing technologies. Its flagship product is VMware vSphere, which is a suite of products used to create and manage virtual machines in a data center. VMware allows for the creation of multiple VMs on a single physical server, which can be easily managed and scaled as needed. It provides features such as high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery for VMs. VMware also offers cloud management and automation tools for managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
