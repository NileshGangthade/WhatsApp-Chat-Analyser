Program is open for third & fourth year engineering students. 
WeтАЩve followed the Campus hiring structure to ensure rigour and make students  industry ready. And so the program has four phases 
Phase 1: Aptitude Assessment
Phase 2:  Domain Assessment
Phase 3: Group Dynamics & Leadership
This year we are doing phase 3 hybrid - 5 Metro Cities and 5 online sessions on Zoom
Phase 4: One-on-one Interaction with the Program Jury

1. ЁЭРБЁЭРЮ ЁЭРйЁЭРлЁЭРЮЁЭРйЁЭРЪЁЭРлЁЭРЮЁЭРЭ ЁЭРЯЁЭРиЁЭРл ЁЭРлЁЭРЮЁЭРЪЁЭРЭЁЭРвЁЭРзЁЭРа: You won't be getting youtube videos to do your daily stuff, but documentations are going to help you a lot. From setting up your system to solving a completely new issue, reading will take you out from any issue.

2. ЁЭРБЁЭРЮ ЁЭРйЁЭРлЁЭРЮЁЭРйЁЭРЪЁЭРлЁЭРЮЁЭРЭ ЁЭРЯЁЭРиЁЭРл ЁЭРЪ ЁЭРзЁЭРЮЁЭР░ ЁЭРнЁЭРЮЁЭРЬЁЭРб ЁЭРмЁЭРнЁЭРЪЁЭРЬЁЭРд: If you are not hired for a specific position(Ex: Android Dev Intern) then you might have to work on a completely new tech stack.

3. ЁЭРГЁЭРиЁЭРз'ЁЭРн ЁЭРнЁЭРбЁЭРвЁЭРзЁЭРд ЁЭРиЁЭРЯ ЁЭРПЁЭРПЁЭРО: Yes, don't take too much pressure for a PPO/conversion. Have it as a long term goal but don't pressurise yourself to work in worst conditions.

4. ЁЭРАЁЭРмЁЭРд ЁЭРзЁЭРвЁЭРЬЁЭРЮЁЭРеЁЭР▓: If you are stuck at a point, try to search on Google/Stack Overflow and then ask your mentor with your research. Always have a positive approach while asking.

5. ЁЭРГЁЭРиЁЭРз'ЁЭРн ЁЭРЯЁЭРЮЁЭРЪЁЭРл ЁЭРнЁЭРи ЁЭРЪЁЭРмЁЭРд: You mentors, Senior Engineers, Managers are going to be your success ladder. Ask if you are stuck, ask if you need suggestions, ask if you want discussions. Obviously they have more work than you but they always try to take out some time for interns.

2/23/23, 17:39 - Sameer Katekar Sir: *A few days back someone asked me how to get a paid means salary based internship.*

Here are a few methods that I have tried and that really work

ЁЯСЙ *Internship cells* -
Every college has its internship cell where students are provided with many opportunities to intern with startups , big 4s .
There are high chances of your selection as you compete with those of your level only .

ЁЯСЙ *LinkedIn*
There are ample opportunities posted on LinkedIn jobs where you can easily apply or apply through the link given .
You can apply various kinds of filters here to niche down your search

ЁЯСЙ *Cold emailing*
Most underrated method which really works.
You can find the ids of recruiters via many ways and can mail them with a good and personalised mail with your cv .

ЁЯСЙ *Unstop (formerly Dare2Compete)*
One stop destination for all college students to apply for jobs, Internships, contests and many more

ЁЯСЙ *Internshala*
Many people use internshala to find internships. *However , I don't have a good experience with it hence putting it on my least priority list*

5/4/23, 09:38 - Sameer Katekar Sir: Dear TPOs, 

Today is the last day to register current TE (2024 BE passout) students for CoCubes. 

The benefits of CoCubes are not only limited to knowing how employable is a student and where improvements are required. CoCubes assessments will help students to prepare for industryтАЩs placement drive assessment exam which are kind of similar in structure (it will give the students a feel of real placement test and prepare them for the eventual). Also, good scores in CoCubes assessments will open up high package profiles in future. 

For those aiming for higher study abroad, CoCubes will help such students assess their preparation for the mathematical logical and communication aptitude of GRE. 

Thus, I kindly request you all to re-counsel the students and get them to register for the assessment. We want all TE students on roll call  to register. If required, seek help of your respected Principal. I have already spoken with your principal.

Thank you

11/1/23, 20:09 - Sameer Katekar Sir: *If a college lacks a training and placement officer, it can have several consequences:*

1. Reduced Job Opportunities: Without a dedicated officer to liaise with companies and organize placement drives, students may have limited access to job opportunities.

2. Missed Skill Development: Training officers often organize workshops and programs to enhance students' employability skills. Without them, students might miss out on these skill-building opportunities.

3. Lack of Guidance: Students may not receive guidance on career choices, resume building, or interview preparation, making their job search more challenging.

4. Decreased Campus Recruitment: Companies may be less inclined to visit the college for recruitment if there is no designated placement officer to facilitate the process.

5. Student Struggles: Students might need to take on the responsibility of organizing placements, which can be overwhelming and distracting from their studies.

Greetings from Dr.D.Y.Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri, Pune!

Please find below the list of students of 2023 batch and 2024 batch shared by seclore company. 
*Process for 2023 batch students will be on Saturday 25th November* and *process for 2024 batch will be on Sunday 26th November.*

Total 2758 students are there from 2023 batch and 4380 students are there from 2024 batch. 

Process will be as follows

*Pen and Paper Problem solving assessment  (Aptitude test)- 30 mins*

Those who will be shortlisted from aptitude test will be having pen and paper *programming test* of *45 mins* on the same day. 

In the excel sheet slotwise reporting time for the students is also given. 

Those who will be shortlisted from Programing test will be having interviews in the next week either at Seclore Mumbai office or Pune office (Not on 25th or 26th November)


Eventhough process was for Pune colleges but as students from other regions have applied, their names are also there in the list.

I would like to inform students from other region whose names are their in the list and also to their TPOs that seclore is one of the best IT company and is very much selective in terms of quality and conversion from aptitude test to programing test and then from programing test to interview and then final selection is very very less. I am sharing this because students travelling from far away from Pune region should be mentally prepared for this.

Students will also receive email from Company and from us in a day or two.

Venue Details: *Dr D Y Patil Unitech Society's Dr.D.Y.Patil Institute of Technology, Sant Tukaram Nagar, Pimpri, Pune*
